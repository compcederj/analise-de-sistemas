                            FUNCTION POINT COUNTING FACILITY


     This Excel Workbook provides a complete function point counting facility. It enables you to:
     . identify and count the individual components of an application,
     . enter an adjustment factor,
     . compute an overall estimate of effort.

          Instructions

                                                    Steps


1    1. Identify the project or application being counted.

     2. List and analyze each of the components of the application.

2a     Internal Logical Files (ILFs)

2b     External Interface Files (EIFs)

2c     External Inputs (EIs)

2d     External Outputs (EOs)

2e     External Queries (EQs)

3    3. Review the Unadjusted Function Point Count.

4    4. Calculate the Value Adjustment Factor.

5    5. Identify a Calibration Factor.

6    6. Identify a Function Point Delivery Rate (in function points per person-month)

7    7. Identify a conversion factor (person-months to person-days).

8    8. Review the high level estimate of total effort.
